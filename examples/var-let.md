⸻

🎯 1) Scope
	•	var → function scope
A var variable is visible anywhere inside the function it’s declared in. If it’s declared outside of a function, it’s global.
	•	let → block scope
A let variable is only visible inside the block where it’s defined — for example, inside { } of an if, for, or while block.

⸻

🎯 2) Hoisting
	•	var variables are hoisted. You can use them before they’re declared, but their value will be undefined.
	•	let variables are also hoisted, but they’re in a “temporal dead zone” until the declaration line. This means you’ll get a ReferenceError if you use them before they’re declared.

⸻

🎯 3) Redeclaration
	•	var can be redeclared in the same scope without error.
	•	let cannot be redeclared in the same scope — attempting to do so will cause an error.

⸻

🎯 4) Why use let?

Modern JavaScript prefers let (and const for constants) because:
	•	Its scope is more predictable.
	•	It prevents accidental redeclarations.
	•	It avoids unexpected behavior due to hoisting.

⸻

💡 Summary:
✅ let: block-scoped, can’t use before declaration, can’t be redeclared.
✅ var: function-scoped, can use before declaration (hoisted), can be redeclared.

Of course — here’s that entire explanation in English:

this difference is very important.
Let’s look at it step by step:

⸻

🎯 Why const fizzBuzzArray = []?

fizzBuzzArray is an array.
Our goal is to never reassign the variable itself — we just want to change its contents.

✅ Example:

const fizzBuzzArray = [];
fizzBuzzArray.push('Fizz'); // Changing the contents — same array is still used.

But:

fizzBuzzArray = ['another', 'new', 'array']; // ❌ Error — cannot reassign the variable

→ That’s exactly what const does: it prevents you from assigning a new array to the variable.

⸻

🎯 Why let count = 1?

count is a numeric variable that will change inside the loop.
We want to increment it (1, then 2, then 3, etc.).

✅ If you used const:

const count = 1;
count++; // ❌ Error — const cannot be changed

✅ That’s why we use let:

let count = 1;
count++; // 👍 This is fine — let allows changing the value


⸻

🎯 Summary:
	•	const → For variables that won’t be reassigned (e.g. the array itself).
	•	let → For variables that will change (e.g. a counter or loop variable).
