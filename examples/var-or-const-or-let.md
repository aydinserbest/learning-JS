Of course — here’s a very simple version in English! 🎯

⸻

🔵 const means “constant”

With const, the variable can’t be reassigned.
But you can still change the contents if it’s an array or an object.

👉 Example:

const name = "Ahmet";
// name = "Mehmet"; ❌ This will cause an error.

const list = [];
list.push(1); ✅ This is OK — we’re still using the same array, just adding to it.


⸻

🔵 let means “variable”

With let, you can reassign the variable as often as you want.

👉 Example:

let number = 1;
number = number + 1; ✅ You can change its value.


⸻

🎯 In the FizzBuzz example:
	•	We use const fizzBuzzArray = [] because we want to use the same array the whole time.
	•	We use let count = 1 because count will change (1, 2, 3, … up to 100).

⸻

💡 That’s it — super simple!
Let me know if you’d also like a shorter summary.

Of course! Here’s the entire explanation in English:

⸻

🔵 Why use let or const instead of var?
	•	When you use var, the variable is function-scoped, which means you can access it anywhere inside the function — even outside of blocks like if, while, or {}.
	•	When you use let, the variable is block-scoped, which is safer because it’s only accessible inside the block where it’s defined.
	•	const is perfect for arrays that don’t need to be reassigned. (It won’t let you assign a new array to the variable, but you can still change the contents of the array.)

For example, for fizzBuzzArray, you can use const.

⸻

✅ Recommended version:
Here’s the same logic, written in a modern and safer way:

const fizzBuzzArray = [];
let count = 1;

function fizzBuzz() {
  while (count <= 100) {
    if (count % 3 === 0 && count % 5 === 0) {
      fizzBuzzArray.push("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (count % 3 === 0) {
      fizzBuzzArray.push("Fizz");
    } else if (count % 5 === 0) {
      fizzBuzzArray.push("Buzz");
    } else {
      fizzBuzzArray.push(count);
    }
    count++;
    console.log(fizzBuzzArray); // Print all at the end if you want
  }
}
fizzBuzz();

🎯 Conclusion:
✅ The logic of the code is correct.
✅ But using let and const instead of var is safer, more readable, and the common practice in modern JS.

🎯 var → function scope

var is function-scoped — it ignores block boundaries.

👉 Example:

function testVar() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // 10 — var is visible outside the if block
}
testVar();

As you can see, x is accessible outside the if block.
That can cause unintended behavior because you probably want the variable to exist only inside the block.

⸻

🎯 let → block scope

let is block-scoped — it only exists inside the block where it’s defined.

👉 Example:

function testLet() {
  if (true) {
    let y = 10;
  }
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
}
testLet();

Here, y exists only inside the if block.
Trying to use it outside the block throws an error.

⸻

🎯 Summary:

✅ var: function scope — ignores block boundaries.
✅ let: block scope — limited to the block it’s defined in.

⸻

💡 That’s why using let is safer and recommended in modern JavaScript.
